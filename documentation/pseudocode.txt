Below is a high-level pseudo code that captures the core logic of your MVP: setting up the Chrome extension, interacting with a FastAPI backend, and integrating with OpenAI for task extraction. It’s not language/framework-specific code but rather an outline of how your components will flow together.

1. Chrome Extension Pseudo Code
lua
Copy code
MANIFEST.JSON
-------------
{
  "name": "AI Email Tasker",
  "version": "0.1",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "permissions": ["identity", "storage", "activeTab", "scripting"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://mail.google.com/"],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  }
  // ... other config as needed
}
background.js (Service Worker)
arduino
Copy code
background.js:
--------------
onInstalled -> 
    - Setup extension defaults (e.g., create initial local storage or do nothing)

onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) -> {
    switch (message.type):
        case "OAUTH_INIT":
            // Start Google OAuth flow if needed, possibly open a new tab 
            // or use chrome.identity APIs
            initiateOAuthFlow()
            break

        // ... handle other message types (like logs, debug, etc.)

    sendResponse({ status: "ok" })
})
popup.html / popup.js
sql
Copy code
popup.js:
---------
onDocumentLoad -> 
    - Check if user is already authenticated (e.g., get tokens from storage)
    - If not authenticated, show a "Sign In with Google" button

onSignInButtonClick ->
    sendMessage to background.js: { type: "OAUTH_INIT" }

onSummarizeButtonClick ->
    1. Get current active Gmail tab or the last open email content reference
    2. Construct request: { emailId, snippet, subject, token }
    3. POST to our FastAPI endpoint: /api/tasks/extract
    4. Receive AI-generated tasks/reply
    5. Display tasks in popup UI (list them, allow user to confirm or discard)

displayTasks(tasks) ->
    - For each task in tasks:
        - Render a row with "title", "due_date" if present
        - Add "Confirm" or "Dismiss" button
content_script.js (Optional: Injecting into Gmail UI)
vbnet
Copy code
content_script.js:
------------------
- (If you decide to embed a sidebar in Gmail)
- On DOM load of Gmail:
    detect Gmail layout 
    createSidebarElement()
    listen for extension messages or user interactions
    if user clicks "Analyze Email", gather thread data -> send to popup or background -> forward to FastAPI
2. FastAPI Backend Pseudo Code
main.py
python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class EmailData(BaseModel):
    email_id: str
    subject: str
    snippet: str
    content: str   # or tokens for retrieving full content
    token: str     # OAuth token from client (if doing client-side token mgmt)

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "FastAPI is running"}

@app.post("/api/tasks/extract")
def extract_tasks(data: EmailData):
    # 1. Optionally fetch full email content from Gmail using `data.token`
    #    or rely on the snippet/content passed in from the extension

    # 2. Call OpenAI to summarize or extract tasks
    ai_response = call_openai_for_tasks(data.subject, data.snippet, data.content)

    # 3. Parse AI response to a structured JSON
    tasks = parse_ai_response_to_tasks(ai_response)

    # 4. Store tasks in DB or in-memory (MVP)
    save_tasks_to_db(tasks)

    return {
        "tasks": tasks,
        "suggested_reply": ai_response.get("suggested_reply", "")
    }

# Additional endpoints:
# - /auth/google for initiating OAuth
# - /auth/google/callback for handling the returned code
# - /api/tasks/list to retrieve user tasks (optional)
OAuth Flow (simplified)
less
Copy code
@app.get("/auth/google")
def google_auth():
    # redirect user to Google's OAuth with required scopes
    oauth_url = generate_google_oauth_url()
    return RedirectResponse(oauth_url)

@app.get("/auth/google/callback")
def google_callback(code: str):
    # Exchange code for access token, refresh token
    token_data = exchange_code_for_token(code)
    # Save tokens to DB (encrypted) or session
    return {"status": "success", "access_token": token_data.access_token}
openai_service.py
python
Copy code
def call_openai_for_tasks(subject: str, snippet: str, content: str) -> dict:
    prompt = f"""
    You are an assistant that extracts actionable tasks and a possible follow-up
    email from the following content.

    Subject: {subject}
    Snippet: {snippet}
    Full Content: {content}

    Return a JSON structure with:
    - "tasks": [ { "title": "", "due_date": "", ... } ]
    - "suggested_reply": "Draft email text"
    """

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                  {"role": "user",   "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.7
    )

    # The actual parsing depends on how the model returns the data (often in `response.choices[0].message.content`)
    return parse_json(response.choices[0].message.content)
db_service.py (MVP)
python
Copy code
tasks_db = []

def save_tasks_to_db(tasks: list):
    # For MVP, just append to an in-memory list or a local SQLite
    global tasks_db
    for t in tasks:
        tasks_db.append(t)

def list_tasks():
    global tasks_db
    return tasks_db
3. Example Flow
Chrome Extension

User clicks “Sign In with Google” in the extension popup.

background.js opens /auth/google in a new tab.
User grants permission, Google redirects to /auth/google/callback.
FastAPI returns access_token, which the extension stores.
User opens a specific email in Gmail.

The extension button: “Summarize & Extract Tasks.”
The extension captures the email subject, snippet, ID (and possibly full content if accessible).
Sends a POST to /api/tasks/extract.
FastAPI

Receives the request, optionally uses the user’s access_token to fetch the full email from Gmail’s API.
Calls call_openai_for_tasks(...) to get tasks and a suggested reply from OpenAI.
Returns a JSON with tasks and suggested_reply.
Extension

Renders the tasks in a small list.
Allows the user to confirm tasks, set or adjust due dates, or copy/paste the suggested reply.
Possibly saves tasks back into the local DB or calls /api/tasks/save.
User Finishes

The user can see tasks later (either in the extension’s “Tasks” view or some simple web page).
A notification or reminder system can be added once tasks have a due date.
Notes & Considerations
Token Storage: Decide if you store tokens in the extension (client-side) or on the FastAPI server (server-side). The latter is more secure.
Data Minimization: For privacy reasons, you might store only minimal email data (ID references, short snippets) rather than entire email contents.
Prompt Engineering: The call_openai_for_tasks function’s prompt is crucial for quality AI results. Iterate on it for better or more structured responses.
Extension vs. Content Script: You can also embed a sidebar in the Gmail UI using content scripts or a library like InboxSDK. The pseudo code above sticks to a simpler popup approach for MVP.
Final Thoughts
This pseudo code shows where and how each piece interacts without diving into the exact syntax for each language or library. You’ll flesh out real code with actual Python/JavaScript, secure OAuth flows, and UI components (HTML/CSS).

With this outline, you can see the end-to-end path:

Chrome Extension captures user input and email data.
FastAPI handles OAuth, calls OpenAI for NLP tasks.
OpenAI returns structured tasks and suggested replies.
FastAPI sends results back, and the extension displays them.
This sets the stage for a functional MVP that you can continue to refine.
